# YourTalk-ChatRoom
This is a simple chatroom-YourTalk. It's the final team project for BIT course _Foundamental Practice of Computer Science_.

In order to get to know this project well, please read the doc _HighLevelDesign.docx_. 

Also, we created a message type used in the communications between Server and Client, please find out more in the doc _CommunicationProtocol.xlsx_.

Hope these docs and source codes can help you.
